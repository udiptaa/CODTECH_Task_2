Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
plotly
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip:

Place the dataset (housing.data.txt) in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.
Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to housing prices. The attributes include CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT, and MEDV. The dataset is loaded using the pandas library and basic statistics are calculated to understand the data better.

Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics for the dataset are calculated using pandas. This includes mean, median, and standard deviation of each attribute, as well as other basic statistical measures.

Visualizations
Scatter Matrix
A scatter matrix is created to visualize the relationships between variables in the dataset. The scatter matrix uses Plotly for interactive visualization, allowing for detailed inspection of variable relationships.

Correlation Heatmap
A correlation heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between numeric columns in the dataset. A custom color scale is used for better visualization of the correlation coefficients.

Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix is calculated to understand the linear relationships between different variables in the dataset. This helps in identifying which variables are strongly correlated with each other and with the target variable (MEDV).

Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models are used to predict housing prices:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
The models are trained using the scikit-learn library, and their performance is evaluated using mean squared error and R-squared metrics. Standard scaling and polynomial feature transformation are applied where necessary.
